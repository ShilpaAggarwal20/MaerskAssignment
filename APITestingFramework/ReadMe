API testing Framework contains three layers, where each layer is present under a package.
1. Actions package which contain methods to hit the API 
  Input param - city and request specification
  Returns response
2. Utility Package which contains method to read the data from excel
  Input param - sheet name and rownum
  Returns response - HashMap where key is column header and value is data in columns
3. Test Cases are present in test package

Scenarios automated
1. Verify response schema is correct
2. Verify that data is presnt for city , temp , weather and country in the response
3. Verify status code when api is hit with incorrect city 
4. Verify status code when api is hit with incorrect appid 

Since there was no connectivity to database so testcases where validations could be done with DB are not automated

Steps to execute
Pre-Requisities
  Maven  should be installed in the system
